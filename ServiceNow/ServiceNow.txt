1. End User
2. Resolver (fulfiller)
    - Helper Desk Technician
    - Fulfiller
3. System Admin


HW: Create a new user. What is the application access doing the new user have?
SOLUTION: 

############ Day 2######################

VM: Virtual Machine 

In the backend there is a Virtual Machine which runs in the backend in of ServiceNow.
This VM deactivates after 10 hrs. of no Use

Agenda: 
    - Learn about User Role assigning 
    - 


The end user will have access to self-service application


## Giving access to End Users to make them Fulfiller
It is found within User Administration->Users
The Tab is called Related List
Using this you can add roles to the organization
    - the most frequent role used is ITIL (fulfiller role)


# USER ADMINISRATION
1. when a role is given more applications are given to the end user or Fulfiller

Different roles are present in the system. 
when a new role is assigned to a user, access related to that application is provided. 

2. Roles-> Partner Roles
When adding a specific role, many more roles are added to the end user. they follow the concept of 
inheritance and all the parent access are 


#############
ASSIGNMENT
1. there is a team working on ASSETS Management and REPORTING Management, find out what are the roles which 
are available in the system.

### 

## Chapter: LIST ADMINISTRATION

What is a List?
The list of the records presents in the table or another application. 
This is listed in the form of Rows and Columns.

Each row is a record of the table.
Each column is a field in the table/form.

## Wildcard - When trying to search for some keyword. You are aware of partial word, 
then you can use wildcard. In ServiceNow the wildcard is "*"
ex: *Aus.

#ASSIGNMENT

UI Property can be used to change the Number of rows which are made to view the lists



#########Types of Cloud Offering 
1. SaaS - Software as a Service
High amount of limitation in this form of service. Low customization. 

2. PaaS - Platform as a Service
Much more capability of customization
    Ex: SFDS(Salesforce), SN

3. IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
    Ex: AWS, Azure, GCP

ServiceNow is a kind of Application Platform as a Service
In ServiceNow the underlying architecture remains same when working on different platforms
Single System of Engagement for the Enterprise 


Three layers of Service Now
1. Nonstop Cloud:
    -Multi instance ### IMPORTANT ####
    Minimum 3 instances exist
    a) Production Instance: ex: deloitte.servicenow.com

    
    b) UAT (User Acceptance Testing) instance: 
    Done at company level, once the features have been unit tested

    deloitte.UAT (Done by the Testing Team)
    once passed by the testing team, it passes to production, or it goes LIVE

    Device Testing:  
    Functionality Testing:
    Blackbox Testing:
    Manual Testing:

    c) DEV instance: ex: deloitte

2. Now Platform 
This is a single data model. 
    -Service Portal 
    -Subscription and Notification
    -Knowledge based
    -service Catalog
    -workflow

3. Cloud Services


# Summary: One Platform, One Data Model but Many Products
Service Now Platform has the capability to connect with any third-party platforms




## Chapter: ARCHITECTURE

1. Hardware
2. VM
3. OS 
4. Middleware
5. Application

In a company there can be three different stacks. All the three Stacks or Instances 
are isolated but do have the capability to communicate among themselves

_________________________________________________________
| DEV INSTANCE   | UAT INSTANCE     |   PRODUCTION INSTANCE |
|________________________________________________________|
| development    | testing          |   No development in   |
| happens here   | happens here     |   production          |
|________________________________________________________|



Around the world there are 10 support centers
and 11 Datacenter Pairs i.e., 22 Datacenter’s in total around the world

This is called as High Availability Pair
    A typically Service Now hosted instance is split over two physical datacenters, forming 
    a High Availability Pair
2 DCs stay in sync always 
There is Never Downtime cause of this strategy

## Chapter: Development 

#### ITIL Concepts

## Incidents: *BREAK FIX* Scenario
    - Something was working suddenly encountering as issue (Not working Anymore)
    - Should be resolved Quickly as the Impact might be high 
    - How Quickly?? (Defined in SLA: Service Level Agreement) 
    - The above depends on priority (priority can be decided based on Impact, Risk and Costs)
    - 

Examples Scenarios of incident creation
-Unable to login
-100 unwanted emails received
-Outlook doesn't load emails since last 1 hr.



## Self Study Notes ###
Service Now Call themselves as Enterprise Cloud Company

## Under USER ADMINISTRATION
Different ways to create user account.
1. Manual User Creation
2. Data Load: Upload in Bulk
3. Integrations to the external sources
    LDAP (lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
        - Active Directory (ID made in the Local Company)
        Central Repository made in the company’s storage 

    SSO (Single Sign On)
        - SML certificate is issued
        - external third-party providers


############ DAY 3 ###############
User data is only accessible by the admin

OOTB - Out of The Box 
OOTB means feature which are part of the product.

#Security Admin Role: This is a Temporary Role
    - This role is under elevated role under login user dropdown
    - Only available for admins 
    - Used to work with Access Controls


What are the different types of Tickets?
There are 4 Types of Tickets
    1. Incident
        Incident application is available under multiple applications
            Self Service Incident: End users select self-service. 

            Service Desk (aka Fulfiller): This allows the Service desk to people to create tickets for others
                In this there are two mandatory fields:
                    1. Caller (Who is raising the ticket)
                    2. Short Description

             _______________________________
            |   Priority = Impact + Urgency |
            |_______________________________|    

            Priority is of five types:
                P1 - Critical
                P2 - High
                P3 - Moderate
                P4 - Low
                P5 - Planning
            
            # Priority Matrix
            ____________________________________________
            |   Impact	|   Urgency     |	Priority    |
            |___________|_______________|_______________|
            |1 - High   |   1 - High    |	1 - Critical|
            |1 - High	|   2 - Medium  |	2 - High    |
            |1 - High	|   3 - Low	    |   3 - Moderate|
            |___________|_______________|_______________|
            |2 - Medium	|   1 - High	|   2 - High    |
            |2 - Medium	|   2 - Medium	|   3 - Moderate|
            |2 - Medium	|   3 - Low	    |   4 - Low     |
            |___________|_______________|_______________|
            |3 - Low	|   1 - High	|   3 - Moderate|
            |3 - Low	|   2 - Medium	|   4 - Low     |
            |3 - Low	|   3 - Low	    |   5 - Planning|
            |___________|_______________|_______________|

            Response Time is Dependent on the SLA 
        
            Once the Ticket has been added in the Incident section, that means the case/incident has been 
            acknowledged (Response SLA) and the state is InProgress
            
            In Incident reporting: Work Notes are Internal documents and additional comments 
            are customer visible.

            WATCH LIST: Update will be sent for every update, filed value modeification and Notification will be 
            sent to the team.

            Additional Comment: 

            It is possible add people to watchlist, they will be able to watch all updates
            
            WORK NOTE LIST: only update on the worknote will be recieved, notification will be sent to people
            who are added to worknote list whenever there is an update or new additional comments added.



            Five Types of Statuses of an Incident
                - New 
                - InProgress
                - On Hold 
                - resolved
                - cancel

            An incident status can be changed from resolve to reopened.


    2. Change
    3. Request 
    4. Problem
    * Task 

# Adding someone to the Ticket group resolution 
makes them part of a separate group in which they can talk among themselves

#Connect Chat Feature: You can start conversation with new people service Now Platform

# It is also possible to read up on the incident history and check logs of when something was 
updated and when, to resolve any conflicts between the groups

## SLA: Service Level Agreement

Agenda: 
    -What is SLA?
        -SLA is an agreement between 2 parties, i.e., 
            -Customer and 
            -Service providers
        -SLA can be confuigured for each:
            -team, 
            -Department
            -Company 
    
    -How Many Types of SLA?

        1. Normal SLA - Which can be customized for a consumer's Use.

        2. OLA (Operational Level Agreement) - Agreement between two parties WITHIN the same organization
            -   Ex: agreement between Sales Team and Delivery Team
                L&D Team and the Project Team
        
         
        3. Underpinning Contract(UC): In these there are three parties which are liable to contract from the \
                contract of previous one.
                
                A-->B-->C

                Service Agreement will be between A and B
                Another Agreement between B and c
                But C is bound by the agreement between A and B
