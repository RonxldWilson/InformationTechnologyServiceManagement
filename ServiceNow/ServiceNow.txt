6. the company started in 2006, and was called Glide Software started by Fred Luddy
7. UI 16
8. There are three major parts on the home screen
    - Header part
    - Filter Navigator: this is primarily used to navigate between the applications and the modules
    - Content Frame: Dynamic data based on application modules selected
    
9. Modules are framed under applications
10. IMPORTANT to set the appropriate time zone of the User Profile & it must be set properly.
    - [DEFAULT] Date and Time format is YYYY-MM-DD
11. Themes can be used to simplify workflow as a developer, when working on multiple instances


## Chapter: Service Now UI
There are two types of UI
1. UI15
2. UI16

Any point of time, you can switch between UI15 and UI16
UI naming convention is based on the year in which it is released

UI15 was released in 2015
UI16 was released in 2016

##ASSIGNMENT
1. Set the theme to Bimley and Share the screenshot in the LMS
2. Switch to UI15 and add a quick link to edge area, this quick link 
    should take you to any specific application

A new Client has come up, which needs customization for its

Question: What are the areas that need to be Customized for a new user?

1. Greet the user with their Company Name or the user with a Username to provide 
    better User Experience
2. Provide a color theme which is appropriate and is in line with the work which they do
3. Provide access to the most accessed/important applications/Modules, to keep a 
    simple UI for the user to facilitate a clean cut UX
4. Bookmarking Certain modules which are critical to the Business needs of the User
5. Provide Time and Date in the preferred system based on the location and preference 
    of the organization.

Solution:

1. Branding 
    -  
2. Time and Date
    - Generally, go for based on Head Quarters (GDPR)
    - Platform time
3. Date format, 
4. Configuring the organization (like who is who's boss)
5. 

## Modules 
1. Basic Configuration - Can be used to setup the basics of a new company like: 
    - Color
    - Date and Time (generally go for the Date and Time of the HQ)
    - logo 
    - Time zones

2. Theme - This module can be used to create custom themes for the organization.
3. Users in User Administration: Can be used to create a new user as well as providing them 
    roles and 

4. #### Impersonate User: impersonation means that you are logging into that user 
profile (Impersonate)


## Chapter: User Administration

Types of Users 
1. End User
2. Resolver (fulfiller)
    - Helper Desk Technician
    - Fulfiller
3. System Admin


HW: Create a new user. What is the application access doing the new user have?
SOLUTION: 

############ Day 2######################

VM: Virtual Machine 

In the backend there is a Virtual Machine which runs in the backend in of ServiceNow.
This VM deactivates after 10 hrs. of no Use

Agenda: 
    - Learn about User Role assigning 
    - 


The end user will have access to self-service application


## Giving access to End Users to make them Fulfiller
It is found within User Administration->Users
The Tab is called Related List
Using this you can add roles to the organization
    - the most frequent role used is ITIL (fulfiller role)


# USER ADMINISRATION
1. when a role is given more applications are given to the end user or Fulfiller

Different roles are present in the system. 
when a new role is assigned to a user, access related to that application is provided. 

2. Roles-> Partner Roles
When adding a specific role, many more roles are added to the end user. they follow the concept of 
inheritance and all the parent access are 


#############
ASSIGNMENT
1. there is a team working on ASSETS Management and REPORTING Management, find out what are the roles which 
are available in the system. 

SOLUTION: 
ASSETS ROLE (asset)
    -inventory user
    -cmdb_query_builder
    -financial_mgmt_user
    -cmdb_read
    -contract_manager
    -category_manager
REPORTING Role (report_admin) XXXXXXXXX
    -report_scheduler	
	-report_global	
	-report_group	
	-gauge_maker	
	-report_publisher	
	-report_alias_admin

Need to use Report user in this scenario

2. Create a Role: "Asset Management" which will grant them access of 
    -Assets
    -Incident
    -Change
    -problem
    -Configuration Items 


############
USER ADMINISRATION has 4 parts
1. Create a User 
2. Types of users
    -End User
    -Fulfiller
    -System Admin
3. Roles
    -out of the box roles
    -adding/removing the roles
    -Creating a custom role
    -Parent role & Partner Role
    -there is another role of impersonator

4. Groups (Teams)
#Things to take care in Group Creation
- Create the Group
- Add Members to the Group
- Add role to the group
- Expectations from group Creation
    - Roles will be inherited to the user profiles
    - once removed roles will be disassociated
ServiceNow offers the option of creating Child groups which transfers the roles to the child 
Group from the parent

5. Delegate
Delegate is transfer of role to a temp person. 
This can be accessed from the User Administration-> Users and then go for delegate by 
assigning a delegate to the user

Delegate can do only four kinds of works 
    - Approvals
    - Assignments
    - All Notifications
    - Meeting Invitations

### 

## Chapter: LIST ADMINISTRATION

What is a List?
The list of the records presents in the table or another application. 
This is listed in the form of Rows and Columns.

Each row is a record of the table.
Each column is a field in the table/form.

## Wildcard - When trying to search for some keyword. You are aware of partial word, 
then you can use wildcard. In ServiceNow the wildcard is "*"
ex: *Aus.

#ASSIGNMENT
Show all the users who belong to company ACME Australia OR ACME North America

Create a filter for the SND group
filter on execution should show all the users who belong to company ACME NA and Department
IT Sales. Exclude Inactive users

# Show matching and Filter Out
If you right click, then you can either Show Matching records or Filter Out 
records easily by just one click.

#ASSIGNMENT
pull a report of all the user which are not VIP and belong to company ACME China or ACME Italy
and download the report in PDF format

#ASSIGNMENT
list all the users present by company by 


UI Property can be used to change the Number of rows which are made to view the lists

######### Types of Cloud Offering #####

1. SaaS - Software as a Service
High amount of limitation in this form of service. Low customization. 

2. PaaS - Platform as a Service
Much more capability of customization
    Ex: SFDS(Salesforce), SN

3. IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
    Ex: AWS, Azure, GCP

ServiceNow is a kind of Application Platform as a Service
In ServiceNow the underlying architecture remains same when working on different platforms
Single System of Engagement for the Enterprise 


Three layers of Service Now || MULTIPLE INSTANCES run in ServiceNow
1. Nonstop Cloud:
    -Multi instance ### IMPORTANT ####
    Minimum 3 instances exist

    a) Production Instance: ex: deloitte.servicenow.com
    
    b) UAT (User Acceptance Testing) instance: 
    Done at company level, once the features have been unit tested

    deloitte.UAT (Done by the Testing Team)
    once passed by the testing team, it passes to production, or it goes LIVE

    Device Testing:  
    Functionality Testing:
    Blackbox Testing:
    Manual Testing:

    c) DEV instance: ex: deloitte

2. Now Platform 
This is a single data model. 
    -Service Portal 
    -Subscription and Notification
    -Knowledge based
    -service Catalog
    -workflow

3. Cloud Services


# Summary: One Platform, One Data Model but Many Products
Service Now Platform has the capability to connect with any third-party platforms


## Chapter: ARCHITECTURE

1. Hardware
2. VM
3. OS 
4. Middleware
5. Application

In a company there can be three different stacks. All the three Stacks or Instances 
are isolated but do have the capability to communicate among themselves

____________________________________________________________
| DEV INSTANCE   | UAT INSTANCE     |   PRODUCTION INSTANCE |
|___________________________________________________________|
| development    | testing          |   No development in   |
| happens here   | happens here     |   production          |
|___________________________________________________________|



Around the world there are 10 support centers
and 11 Datacenter Pairs i.e., 22 Datacenter’s in total around the world

This is called as High Availability Pair
    A typically Service Now hosted instance is split over two physical datacenters, forming 
    a High Availability Pair
2 DCs stay in sync always 
There is Never Downtime cause of this strategy

## Chapter: Development 

#### ITIL Concepts

## Incidents: *BREAK FIX* Scenario
    - Something was working suddenly encountering as issue (Not working Anymore)
    - Should be resolved Quickly as the Impact might be high 
    - How Quickly?? (Defined in SLA: Service Level Agreement) 
    - The above depends on priority (priority can be decided based on Impact, Risk and Costs)

Examples Scenarios of incident creation
-Unable to login
-100 unwanted emails received
-Outlook doesn't load emails since last 1 hr.

## SELF STUDY NOTES ##
Service Now Call themselves as Enterprise Cloud Company

## Under USER ADMINISTRATION
Different ways to create user account.
1. Manual User Creation
2. Data Load: Upload in Bulk
3. Integrations to the external sources
    LDAP (lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
        - Active Directory (ID made in the Local Company)
        Central Repository made in the company’s storage 

4. SSO (Single Sign On)
        - SML certificate is issued
        - external third-party providers
5. Use of workday is also possible for Integration of user record creation
 


############ DAY 3 ###############
User data is only accessible by the admin

OOTB - Out of The Box 
OOTB means feature which are part of the product.

#Security Admin Role: This is a Temporary Role
    - This role is under elevated role under login user dropdown
    - Only available for admins 
    - Used to work with Access Controls

What are the different types of Tickets?
There are 4 Types of Tickets
    1. Incident
        Incident application is available under multiple applications
            Self Service Incident: End users select self-service. 

            Service Desk (aka Fulfiller): This allows the Service desk to people to create tickets for others
                In this there are two mandatory fields:
                    1. Caller (Who is raising the ticket)
                    2. Short Description

             _______________________________
            |   Priority = Impact + Urgency |
            |_______________________________|    

            Priority is of five types:
                P1 - Critical
                P2 - High
                P3 - Moderate
                P4 - Low
                P5 - Planning
            
            # Priority Matrix
            ____________________________________________
            |   Impact	|   Urgency     |	Priority    |
            |___________|_______________|_______________|
            |1 - High   |   1 - High    |	1 - Critical|
            |1 - High	|   2 - Medium  |	2 - High    |
            |1 - High	|   3 - Low	    |   3 - Moderate|
            |___________|_______________|_______________|
            |2 - Medium	|   1 - High	|   2 - High    |
            |2 - Medium	|   2 - Medium	|   3 - Moderate|
            |2 - Medium	|   3 - Low	    |   4 - Low     |
            |___________|_______________|_______________|
            |3 - Low	|   1 - High	|   3 - Moderate|
            |3 - Low	|   2 - Medium	|   4 - Low     |
            |3 - Low	|   3 - Low	    |   5 - Planning|
            |___________|_______________|_______________|

            Response Time is Dependent on the SLA 
        
            Once the Ticket has been added in the Incident section, that means the case/incident has been 
            acknowledged (Response SLA) and the state is InProgress
            
            In Incident reporting: Work Notes are Internal documents and additional comments 
            are customer visible.

            WATCH LIST: Update will be sent for every update, filed value modeification and Notification will be 
            sent to the team.

            Additional Comment: 

            It is possible add people to watchlist, they will be able to watch all updates
            
            WORK NOTE LIST: only update on the worknote will be recieved, notification will be sent to people
            who are added to worknote list whenever there is an update or new additional comments added.

            Five Types of Statuses of an Incident(Life Cycles)
                - New
                - InProgress
                - On Hold

#################### Day 4 ############################

## SLA: Service Level Agreement

Agenda: 
    -What is SLA?
        -SLA is an agreement between 2 parties, i.e., 
            -Customer and 
            -Service providers
        -SLA can be confuigured for each:
            -team, 
            -Department
            -Company 
    
    -How Many Types of SLA?

        1. Normal SLA - Which can be customized for a consumer's Use.

        2. OLA (Operational Level Agreement) - Agreement between two parties WITHIN the same organization
            -   Ex: agreement between Sales Team and Delivery Team
                L&D Team and the Project Team
        
         
        3. Underpinning Contract(UC): In these there are three parties which are liable to contract from the \
                contract of previous one.
                
                A-->B-->C

                Service Agreement will be between A and B
                Another Agreement between B and c
                But C is bound by the agreement between A and B

    -Understanding SLA?
    
    
    -Examples of SLA?
    
    -What are the usecases of SLA?

## Assignment
    Define SLA for the Hardware team, any incident assigned to the team with priority 2
    must be resolved within 2 mins

###### SLA: Service Level Agreement

# Schedule: Working hours of team is added in the schedule
    -If put No schedule, it will run 24/7
    
#Three options available in the SLA definintion:
    Start Condition
    Pause Condition
        it will be paused on two status
            1. is on hold 
            2. Resolved 
    Stop Condition
#####
    Five Types of Statuses of an Incident(Life Cycles)
                - New
                - InProgress
                - On Hold 
                - Resolved                      //
                - Closed                        // In these two cases the SLA is paused
                - Cancel


## Assignmet: Create a OLA for the IT department any incident assigned to IT department and Software group
must be responded within 5 minutes and resolved with 10 mins.

SLA Agreements can be automatically invoked as soon as an incident is created

To Creaate SLA Agreement, open the SLA tab and create new SLA, 
    Define the Start Conditions of Incidents 
    Define the Pause Conditions of Incidents 
    Define the Stop Conditons of Incidents 

The Purpose of SLA is to create Accountability within the organization

In SLA there is an option to define Schedules on which the schedule will run.   

How to Create New schedile

1. Create a insert and Stay 
2. Then go to create 
########## HW ###########

Create a Schedule for 9-6 weekdays excluding holidays(India Calendar) (Aug- Dec)

## ITSM Suites
1. Incident Management
2. Service Level Management
3. Problem Management
4. Knowledge Management
5. Change Management
6. Service Request Management
7. CI Management
8. Asset Management
9. Release Management


## Chapter: PROBLEM MANAGEMENT

A problem is created when there is 
    -a repeated issue or 
    - the issue is appearing frequently
    - Vendor Dependency

when such kind of issues happen we need to create a problem ticket
PREREQUISITE for problem creation is that there needs to be existing Incidents

Life Cycle of Problem Tickets
    - New
    - Assess
    - RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
    - Fix in Progress
    - Resolved
    - Closed

Once an Incident has been upgraded to a Problem then we need to attach all the related incidents(if any)
to the same Incident(i.e., create a Child - Parent association between the incidents)

The Problem needs to go one by one through all the stages of life cycle to be resolved

if the problems come back after sometime, it can be sent to reanalyse, so that the problem is resolved again

###### Knowledge Management ####

-> Knowledge Articles - Helps resolver teams to resolve the incident faster
-> Knowledge Articles (KA) - are grouped under the KB(Knowledge Base)
-> KA Publish/Retire needs Approval 

# Createe a Knowledge base called: Deloitte ServiceNow Training
# Owner of this Knowledge Base is Fred Luddy
# Then create a Knowledge Article and the article name is Deloitte ITSM Training
# 

Once knowledge articles are added to the specific knowledge base. 
It shows up in while filling for incident report by the service desk
This helps in quick resolution of the Incident and saves costs.

if the Service Desk agent is satisfied, thay can tag the article to the incident
which gets added as an additional comment, this commment is sent to the user who can 
then DIY the solution to his requirements

### Assignemnt

Create a knowledge article for the Java installation issue, place it under IT --> Java category_manager
Create-> Publish -> Test and confirm

## CHANGE MANAGEMENT ##

- Whenever there is an Infrastructure change 
- There needs to be Impact Analysis before the chamge is implemented
- Sometimes there may be cost associated with the change
- It might also require approval

# Types of Change Management
    1. Normal Change: Approval required for Change
    2. Standard Change: Already Approved for Change. No Approval required
        there is no business imapct when standard change is implemented.

    3. Emergency Change: Approval required

#Life cycle of Change Request
    1. New: 
    2. Assess
    3. Authorise
    4. Schedule 
    5. implement
    6. Review
    7. Closed/Cancelled


     _________________________________________________________
    |   Stages  |   Normal  |   Emergency   |   Standard     |    
    |________________________________________________________|
    |   New     |   Yes     |   Yes         |   Yes          |

CAB : Change Advisory Board
In CAB meetings the approval of one member is enought to grant the work to be done on the next stage.
The vote of the CAB needs to be unanimus, as having this kind of roll back leads to questions on the board
and is a bad remark on the working of the board.

Create a Standard Change Template

################### Day 5 #####################

Development in ServiceNow

-How to start Development
-How to capture the development
-How to move the code between the instances
-Update Set (kind of like VCS for ServiceNow)


## UPDATE SET ##
- Update set is used to capture the Development Activites
- The Applcaition used to use Update Set is local update set


Update set will start capturing the development activities only when it is current

Switching between diffrent update set is possible, in the sttiing gear option, then go to 
developer and select which update set you are working on.

This can be used when working on multiple features 

TABLES

Any custon table that developer creates, will have a prefix. that will be u_LABEL
the U stands for User defined Tables

6 fields will be created automatically
1. Created by
2. Created
3. Sys_ID
4. updates
5. Updated by
6. Updated


#10 Observations when new Table is Created
1. A PRIMARY KEY is assigned to the table (This cannot be Null)
2. Access control is defined on the Table, like what all operations are possible on the Table
3. Max Length is defined for each of the 6 fields which are created by default
4. There is an option to define application access 
    By default it is set to Read only by the applications that means that the application 
    can only read the tables
    
    There is also an option to allow the access of the table via web services
5. Security Roles need to be defined if any one other than the system admin wants to work 
    on the appliaction. This is also called as ACLs
 
6. Adding new fields is also possible through this instance
7. There is an option in Labels-> for label as well as Plurals???
8. There is something called as Table Subscription Model???
9. Access to the various UI of the Tables are possible thru this screen like:
    - Design Form
    - Layout Form
    - Layout List
    - View the Form
    - Can also view the Schema Form
    - Can define REST API as well for the Table 
    - Can Run Point Scan ????

10. Adding Auto Numbering is possible 
    - Use auto-numbering to define a sequential identifying code made up of a prefix, 
    a base number and a padding value to ensure a consistent format



## As soon as the Table is created: The Correspomding Application will be created for it

Now if we go back and check the UpdateSet, all the changes done in the table have been recorded in the 
specific updateset whihc was invoked

While Viewing the Update Set, you can see all the changes which has been done in a specific list of all the updates


## IMPORTING THE UPDATE SET FROM DIFFRENT Developer

1. Click on Retrieve update sets



 
########## UpDate Set Notes ####
1. Create new Update set. 
2. Start Capturing, so from now on whatever happens will be recorded in the specific instance of the update set
3. Once the required updates have been done, you can either move on to a diffrent update set from setting
    or move on to defalult update set
4. Once, you are satisfied with the update set, you can export the update set in XML format and share it with other
    developers, 

5. To import an update set from a different developer, go to Retrieved Update Set and click on Import
6. Once an update set has been imported, procced to preview the changes before commiting them to your system
7. If there are no merge conflicts, then procced to accept the new commits into the appication
8. When this is done, all the changes imported will be implemented into the instance.

## Merging Two Update Sets is possible to create a new update set which is the merged form of both.


## Update Source

Refer any completed updateset present in the source instance.
Direct pulling from Dev instance to the UAT instance is possible
No export/import is required in this


##TEAM DEVELOPMENT
# Remote Instance is used to connect between two instances, using this all the complete update sets are visible
in the other end, you can get all the upodate sets to this 



## TABLES

Whenever there is a new Table which is created it comes with "U_"

To give access of a particular applicatio to a user, just give the role to the user of that particular Application


# SYS_ID is the unique identifier for all the records

####################################################
SYS ID 
Every Record in ServiceNow has an unique identifier called as SYS ID
It is a 32 char long alpha numeric character



Just Right click on top of any record, this will lead to the option for copying the SYS ID

Steps to DEVELOPMENT

STEP 1: Always create an update set before starting any developement activity.

        ALWAYS CREATE A *LOCAL UPDATE SET*
        Without creating this, the development process has no meaning 

STEP 2: Then Go on To create Tables and Finish development of the application

STEP 3: Once Satisfied with the work, then move the Update set status to Complete.

STEP 4: 


NOTE: It is possible to share the access of just one application to any of the user

######################

SECURITY ADMIN ROLES: This can be assigned to someone if they do not want the system admin 
to see their data

ServiceNow platform for large companies is integrated with their Identity Provider services

Managing user sessions
ServiceNow offers multiple ways to manage user sessions. While administrators
have the ability to impersonate any user, they can also completely lockout the
user, make users inactive, or terminate any individual user session.

Security
As a best practice, I recommend not to directly assign roles to any user. Instead,
we should first create a relevant group, if one doesn't already exist, and assign
roles to this group. A group can have multiple roles assigned and also roles can
contain other roles as needed. These features give an immense level of flexibility
to the administrators and ensure that things do not get complex.
Administrators can define the Access Control List (ACL) to limit read, write,
create, and delete access for field data, records, and tables. With this granular
security ability, you may need to create additional groups for elevated
permissions


UpdateSet is diffrent from Git in the Sense that, GIT is Version Control, 
whereas UpdateSet is about caputring the development activvities

Extending a Table: This is the standard of the ServiceNow architecture
In the Control: select EXTENSIBLE checkbox

This feature is used to implement the feature of Data Normalization.


#Dictionary 
The System Definition | Dictionary module has an entry for each table and
column in the database. As direct access to the database is not provided to
ServiceNow customers, the dictionary offers a way to access the information on
the database schema. It is also referred to as the data dictionary.
The Dictionary module lists data stored in the sys_dictionary table, referred to as
the dictionary entry. It is equivalent to the database dictionary property of the
tables and column objects in any RDBMS.

################# DAY 6 #######################

#TABLE ADVANCED

Extended Table is like the superset of Base Table 
Extended Table = Base Table + Additional Fields

Important to ensure that the the Base Table is marked as Extensible in the Controls

Q: How to manage the roles Created along with the new roles?
ANS: 

The Primary benefit of Extending tables is that, it helps in applying Data Normalization
Normalization means to not store the same data in multiple Tables
To avoid data reduncancy

# The Structure of the Table is copied in extending the Table and not the Data of the Table

## Diffrences Between the original Table and the extended Table
-> It is possible to delete the copied structure of the tables  
    -> DO NOT DELETE this is as there will be an impact on the base fields

-> additional row creation is also possible
-> The controls are not passed on to the extended Table
    -> it needs to be enabled seperately
-> There are two sys IDs (but how are there two SYS IDs ????)
    This Entry was created in the Extended Table
        27403f8347a11110c68ca368436d435c
    This entry was created in the base table by default
        27403f8347a11110c68ca368436d435c

-> The DataBase Indexes in the Extended table refer to the base table 

Every Table has it's own autonumbering, when extending it will be turned off by default

### ASSIGNMENT
Find the Source Table for Incident, Change and Problem  
TASK Table is the Source Table 

####

Task Table

The Task table is one of the most important tables in the ServiceNow instance.
Many tables extend the Task table. Thus, it is the parent class of many other
tables, such as Incident, Change Task, Problem, and so on. Using the Tables
modules, we can open the Task table entry to view a list of all available columns
under the Columns tab, as shown in the following screenshot.


################# FORM DESIGN ###############
1. Tools available in form Design
2. It is an interface using which we can add new Fields
3. Also, will be able to select the appropriate field types to be used
    Example: Date Field, String, Refernce
4. Gives the option to create layout + Form Sections as well 
5. 


WHENEVER CREATING A NEW FIELD IN THE FORM DESIGN, MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE BACKEND NAME

This backend name cannot be changed, once it is created
Prefix should be u_<field_name>

################# BASE TABLES ##################

What is a Base Table?

What are the base tables in service now?
Two base Tables are present
    1. Task Table
    2. CMDB Table

And how are they extended


########### 
TABLE NAMES FOR THE FOLLOWING FORMS
1. User     -   	    sys_user
2. Role     -           sys_user_role
3. Group    -           sys_user_group
4. Group Membership -   sys_user_grmember
########### 

PREFIXES IN TABLE
1. sys : System Generated
2. CMDB: Configuration Management related
3. ALM : Asset life Management          // used by asset Management team
4. imp : Import set related
5. u_ : User Defined
6. SLA : Service Level Agreement




Step 1: Create a new UPDATE SET: "People"
Step 2: Create a new table and extend it from "sys_user", this shall give all the necessary fields




Edit the Name of the Header as Basic Perosn Info.

Step 3: Create Various Sections within this 
    - First is the Default One,
    - Sec 2 is Security Information
    - Sec 3 is Assignment Information

Step 4: Add the specific Fields with each of the Validation done correctly on it
Step 5:

DATA LOADING CONCEPT / IMPORT SET

What is Load Data?

How to Load Bulk Records into any table?

What are the Steps involved?

0. DataLoad Template
    -Preperation & Validation

    Send a Template to the client to send the required data in this format in excel
    
1. Import Set
2. Transform Map
3. Tools used during the Transform Map  
    a) Auto Map
    b) Mapping Assist
4. Transform the Target Table


Benefits of Load Data?

Use-Cases
1. Adding new Users
2. Update existing records and create those records which doesn't exist with refernce to 
    the provided data




# Creating a DataLoad Template for user load

First Get the user records in excel format,
once that is done, go to load data, to add the new records to table
then select, what is to be done with it. If it needs to be added or not


############### COALESCE

Coalesce meaning defining the unique identifer
Example: User id is defined as Coalesce that means system is instructd to find and update the record if it exists
if it doesn't exist, then create the record

###################

No need to create the Transform Map againa and again, if the same data will be 
used to add and update record field 

Just ReRun the already created Transform Map to get the new data added to the table.



- Implement New Customer 
- Company Name : Rebooted 
- Company will have the following "Foundation Data" 
-   - Company 
    - Departments - 20 Departments 
    - Department Names : RBT DEPT-01 till RBT DEPT-20 
    - Teams - 50 Teams - RBT GRP-01 till RBT GRP-50 
    - Users - 1000 - Rebooted 01 till Rebooted 1001 
    - User Roles 
    - Location - 10 Location 
    - Location Names : RBT LOC-01 till RBT LOC-10 Rebooted 01 to Rebooted 100 --> RBT GRP-01




Location: cmn_location
Department: cmn_department


    To Shift the DATA between diffrent instancs is possible, firstly create find the data
    which is to be shifted and then convert it to XML format, once that is done,
    it can be shared to other instance as well.

    To load an instance, go to the column header and then right-click and select
    import, this will allow the import of the data, through an XML format

########## LDAP: lightweight Directory Access Protocol

LDAP is a central Repository of all the user related information
It can be integrated with ServiceNow and Other Systems
Benefits
    Creation of users and their access can be automated


Label: can be changed
Name: Name is used in backend and CANNOT be changed

#Reporting and Dashboarding

Report Types (Available under Report Section)
1. Out of the Box reports - Those reports which are provided by the system
2. Custom Reports - Reports created later


In both the above scenario it is possible to edit both kinds of reports

How to manage new Report creations

# Dot Walking 
- we can use any common reference field in the table 
to refer the data in the other table

Example: 


DASHBOARD

dashboard Contains Widgets
Each widget is a report
Reports are embeded on the dashboard
Indicators are also called as Matrix

Example: 
1.  Create a dashboard : Ron_Dashboard
    The Dashboard will contain all the information related to incident manangment 

## SCHEDULED REPORT


Possible to schedule the execution of report 

## Sharing a report 
Share the report with a group or with a particular user at a particular time

Workflow & Service Catalog

# WorkFlow - Used to automate the sequence of activities

Example: used in SLA definitions
Flow & Workflow

2. Also available in change Management

3. Problem Management 
4. & knowledge Article


Workflow -  It is a sequence of activities

iN Filter Navigator -> Workflow Editor

How to view the list of the workflows present in the system

Two states of workflow
1. Published - Currently in use
2. Checked Out - Manintanince

The arrow mark in workflow is called as Transitions

Each box is an activity

On the side there is an option to add Core activities while designing new activities

To modify an existing workflow you need to be in the Checkout state

Workflow Versions - each time a workflow is cheked out and published it creates a new veriosn in Workflow Version

##IMP: Workflows are implemented on certain Tables

Request Table : sc_req_item

Creating new workflow is simple, just got to workflow and click on add symbol
and define the workflow based on the requirements

### Service Catalog
##The point of service Catlog is that it decreases cost and increases efficiency.
Through self service catlog cost and efficiency is improved
->Hire the Employees
->Maintain Assets
->Location
->software 
->Internet Telephone

Limitation
    -> Delay in providing service

>>> Service Catalog 

	- Types of Service Catalog
			- Service Catalog
			- Record Producer
			- Order Pr

	
1. Once the service catalog is executed it will produce 
		REQ
		RITM
		SCTASK

2. Service Catalog uses WorkFlow or Flow in the Backend
	WorkFlow / Flow will provide the Backend Logic which controls the steos in the catalog execution


--> Excercise - 
		Similar to the Excercise of WorkFlow
	Create a Service Catalogue to request for the new SOftware Installation on your laptop, while taking this request following questions to be Asked

	Q1 : Requested for

	Q2 : Name of the Software 
		Choice 1 : Microsoft Projects
		Choice 2 : Adobe Reader
		Choice 3 : outlook
	
	Q3 : Joining Location 

Solution : 

	1. Filter Navigator --> Maintain Items
	Maintain Items Shows all the different Catalogs or items which is OOTB

	2. Click New to create a brand New Catalog

	3. Add the Name : Request for the New Software Installation 

		Here Catalogs is very important - It determines the Visibility 
	
	4. Choose Service Catalogs

	5. Category --> Services

	6. After creating this to use this Save this 

	7. Go to the Service Portal and check for the catalog in the Office -- Services 

	8. Then add the Description 

	9. Process Engine - is the Backend Logic 
						It is the WorkFlow
						We have to make sure that the WorkFlow is in published State

	10. Then picture the Look and Feel 

	11. Pricing is not needed 

	12. Go to Service Portal and check 

To change Add to Cart, Quantity and Delivery Time 

	13. Portal Settings and hide all that you dont need and also change the Request Method to Request

--> Here most important is adding the catalog while creating catalog Item 
	Else the Catalog will not appear in the Portal


>> How to add the Questions in the Catalog

	- Variables are like the fields in the Form Design
	- It is used to add different questions here
>> Variables - variables are the questions available on the catlog
Used to recive input to requester
we have diffrent types of variables to be selected
    -> reference
    -> String
    -> Select Box

	
	14. New
		Type --> Reference
		Add Question
		Name : u_

		In the Type Specification add the reference table name

	15. Add Second Question 
		Type --> Select Box
		Add Question 
		Name : u_

		Below it will allow to add choices 
			- Click on New and all the choices
			- Add the value for the choice also
		
		Choose Include None in the Type Specification

		This will show the None Option by Default

	16. Add Third Location 
		Type --> Reference
		Add Question 
		Name : u_

		Then in Type Specification add the reference table name

	
	17. Now check the Service Portal
